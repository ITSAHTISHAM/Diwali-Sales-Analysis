# Diwali Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a Diwali sales period to uncover insights and trends that can help in decision-making for future sales strategies. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to provide a comprehensive view of the sales performance.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from [mention source if any, or briefly describe the dataset].

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **Diwali Sales Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, including data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- **images/**: Directory containing images and plots generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation and Setup
To run the analysis, you'll need the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Required Python Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Analysis and Insights
The analysis is divided into several sections:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Data type conversions
- Correcting inconsistencies

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Exploring the dataset to find patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables.

### 3. Visualizations
